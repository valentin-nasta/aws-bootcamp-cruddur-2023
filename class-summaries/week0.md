# Considerations
## Lucid Charts and Link Logical Diagram
Here is the share link to the [Cruddur Logical Architectural Diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/6f80cd2d-7d18-4731-aadc-bdda9773c092/edit?viewport_loc=-377%2C-21%2C1675%2C919%2CB22sg4pRbxQV&invitationId=inv_c648fee2-f691-443d-8602-7e959b41a18d) seen in Lucid. You need a Lucid account to view it.

Its strongly recommended that you use Lucid to create your diagram and place the share link with a screenshot to the chart you built in your journal.
Sharing a Lucid chart link is better proof than just a screenshot.

# Napkin Design
Bonus points if you get a real napkin, and do your conceptual design on the napkin, take a photo on your phone, and display it in your week 0 journal.
Remember, there is more than one way to make a conceptual diagram so try not to do exactly what we did.
